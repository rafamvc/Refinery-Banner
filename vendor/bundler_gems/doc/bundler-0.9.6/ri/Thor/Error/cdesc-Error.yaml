- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Thor::Error is raised when it's caused by wrong usage of thor classes. Those errors have their backtrace supressed and are nicely shown to the user.

  body: Errors that are caused by the developer, like declaring a method which overwrites a thor keyword, it SHOULD NOT raise a Thor::Error. This way, we ensure that developer errors are shown with full backtrace.
